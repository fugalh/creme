Crème Rappel
http://hans.fugal.net/src/creme/

Synopsis
--------

    creme 1200 lunchtime
    creme 1710 go catch the bus
    creme +1h zone check

Requirements
------------

    - Ruby (included in OS X Tiger and above)
    - Growl
    - growlnotify (distributed with Growl in the Extras folder. Run install.sh)

Installation
------------

Look at the top of bin/creme and make any configuration changes you like. Then,
do

    sudo ruby setup.rb

Details
-------

    creme [timespec [message]]

If message is omitted, it is expected on stdin. If both are omitted, then
multiple notifications can be specified, one per line.

Timespecs are compatible with at(1), but more friendly. For example, you can do 
"+5m" instead of "+ 5 minutes".

Application Bundle
------------------

Crème Rappel now has a self-contained application bundle, so you can put it in
the dock or launch it with quicksilver. It requires only Growl. When you give
it a command it will display the timestamp and pid in a growl message.

If you put a command in ~/.creme/default it will be the default. This is useful
if you frequently need to issue the same command (e.g. whenever my wife tells
me she's coming to pick me up, I do "+7 erin" so I can meet her outside).

Troubleshooting
---------------

If bash can't find creme after running setup.rb, you may need to symlink or
adjust PATH if you're using Leopard's Ruby.  Something like this in your
~/.bashrc :

    export PATH=$PATH:/System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/bin

If you get an annoying warning something like this

    creme:9: warning: Insecure world writable dir /usr/local/mysql/bin in PATH, mode 040777

then you can add -W0 to the shebang line (the first line of the script). So the
new shebang line would look like

    #! /usr/bin/ruby -W0

But really, see if there's another safer way to work around the MySQL
wonkiness, than a world-writable path entry.
